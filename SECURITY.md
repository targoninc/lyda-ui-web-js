# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of the /main branch is officially supported. This is the same version as deployed on https://lyda.app.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you spot a vulnerability, please disclose it via administration@targoninc.com. We'll get back to you as fast as possible, usually within 7 working days.
We do not generally reward reports with bounties, but might choose to do so if the report was critical enough to warrant a bounty. We might change this system in the future.
